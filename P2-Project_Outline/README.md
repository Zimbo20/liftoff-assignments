## Submission Instructions

### Overview

My project will have immediate real-world value.  I am making an application for my mother-in-law who lives and owns a market in Harare, Zimbabwe.  This project will expand over time, but the initial functionality will simply be to have a site where the individual vendors can login and, by clicking on a box, indicate whether or not they will be participating on given market days.  The market, called Upmarket, is open on Wednesdays and Saturdays.

### Features

Registration page: Each vendor must register to create an account.
User login: Vendors will use login and password info to enter the app.  The administrator will have a separate login, and will be able to see which vendors have checked in.
Calendar and text box function: a checkbox will appear next to market days on a calendar.  Vendors will indicate which days they will be at the market and have the option to send a short message to the administrator.  The information will be sent via email to the administrator.

### Technologies
C#
ASP.NET Core MVC
Bootstrap
HTML, CSS
SQL database

### What I'll Have to Learn

This is a funny question because I still have so much to learn - even about the things we just learned!
I will be re-learning plenty of aspects of C#, ASP.NET, HTML/CSS and SQL that I didn't get down pat in LC101.
I will learn how to use Bootstrap, which I think might handle the calendar and email function?
